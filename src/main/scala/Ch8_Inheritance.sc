// As in Java, you can declare a class final so that it cannot be extended.
// You can also declare individual methods or fields final so that they cannot be overridden

// A field or method can be declared protected. Such a member is accessible from any class but not from other locations
// Unlike in java, a protected member is not visible throughout the package to which the class belongs.
// A class has one primary constructor and any number of auxiliary constructors, and that
// all auxiliary constructors must start with a call to a preceding auxiliary constructor or primary constructor
// In consequence, the auxiliary constructors can never invoke superclass constructor directly. Only primary constructor can call a super class constructor
