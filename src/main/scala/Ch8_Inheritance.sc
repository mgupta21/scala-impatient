// As in Java, you can declare a class final so that it cannot be extended.
// You can also declare individual methods or fields final so that they cannot be overridden

// A field or method can be declared protected. Such a member is accessible from any class but not from other locations
// Unlike in java, a protected member is not visible throughout the package to which the class belongs.
// A class has one primary constructor and any number of auxiliary constructors, and that
// all auxiliary constructors must start with a call to a preceding auxiliary constructor or primary constructor
// In consequence, the auxiliary constructors can never invoke superclass constructor directly. Only primary constructor can call a super class constructor

// Construction Order

// Order
// The Ant constructor calls the creature constructor before doing its own construction
// the range is overridden in Ant so env calls range and sets range to 0
// Ant sets the range to 2
// Do Not Rely on value of val in body of constructor

// Solution
// Declare val as final
// Declare val as lazy in superclass
// Use early definition syntax in the subclass, lets you initialize val fields of a subclass before the superclass
